# Algorithms

I am doing this for **learning purposes**.

Algorithms are from the following books:
	* Introduction to algorithms, 3rd edition by Charles E. Leiserson
	* The art of computer programming, by Donald Knuth (1-3)

I am trying to do **all** the algorithms from both of the books, and slowly push it to this repository.
All the algorithms will be written in **C** and hopefully, some will be translated to **C++** and **Python** and perhaps
in the end of my readings I will have all the translations done.

All the algorithms are being drawn in a paper (step by step and some with mathematical equations) and soon will be pushed to this repository.
Maybe I will also write a blog post for each algorithm, explaning why and how it works, if I do, I will update this.

The are two main directories, one for *Introduction to algorithms* and another for *The art of computer programming*. Each directory,
has sub-directory with the language. Keep in mind that **ALL** algorithms are written in C, and some, slowly, will be written in other languages.

Each file, has a comment, with the page number of the book and the section, like ```Page 16, 2.1```.

Also, keep in mind that I am reading **one** book at a time.

If you find any errors, submit a new issue or a pull request.

Feel free to use any algorithm written here.
