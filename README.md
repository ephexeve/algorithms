# Algorithms

Algorithms from the following books:
	* Introduction to algorithms, 3rd edition by Charles E. Leiserson
	* The art of computer programming, by Donald Knuth (1-3)

I am trying to do **all** the algorithms from both of the books, and slowly push it to this repository.
All the algorithms will be written in **C** and hopefully, in the near future, translated to **C++** and **Python**.

If you find any errors, submit a new issue or a pull request.
